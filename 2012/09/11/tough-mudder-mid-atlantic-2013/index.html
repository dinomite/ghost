            <p>After not doing Tough Mudder <a href="http://dinomite.net/blog/2010/tough-mudder-norcal-2010/">since 2010</a>, <br />
I signed up for the Mid-Atlantic event this year.  Here's my advice for folks <br />
looking for tips before running.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I've exercised almost exclusively in <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm">Vibram <br />
FiveFingers</a> mainly because I feel <br />
so much more stable when running &amp; jumping.  Since switching to minimalist <br />
street shoes for everyday wear (<a href="http://www.merrell.com/US/en-us/Product.mvc.aspx/22875M/50390/Mens/Barefoot-Run-Trail-Glove">Merrell Trail Gloves</a> <br />
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004KZP5AG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B004KZP5AG&amp;adid=05E13DHZT6EMTB01FEFZ">New Balance Minimus</a>) <br />
my knees, hips, and back seem happier.  Last time I did Tough Mudder, I wore <br />
some old cross-trainer style tennis shoes, but by this point I've gotten rid of <br />
all the thick-soled tennis shoes I once had.  I ended up wearing my New Balance <br />
MT20s for the run and they worked very well.  Clearning them after the race was <br />
just a few minutes of hosing them off outside and then tossing them in the <br />
washing machine.</p>

<p>I wore some Mechanix gloves (the basic velcro cuff model) the first time I did <br />
Tough Mudder.  This time I brought some along but chose not to wear them. There <br />
are only a couple of obstacles for which you might want them, and I don't think <br />
those are sufficiently abrasive or splintery to extra mudweight you carry in <br />
gloves.  Focus on wearing as little clothing as possible—the first time you hit <br />
a mud pit your shirt &amp; shorts carry a lot of it with you.</p>

<p>Training is another big question that people have.  Mine is pretty much the same <br />
as previously: I do CrossFit 2-3 times a week and 1-2 days a week of Olympic <br />
lifting.  In the 6 months prior to doing Tough Mudder I went on a couple of ~3.5 <br />
mile runs.  The only other running I did was the occasional CrossFit WOD that <br />
involved a 400 or 800 meter run.  I think that pretty well drives home my <br />
admonition that you don't need to run a lot to be a competent runner and perform <br />
well in endurance running events.</p>

<p>Having said that, this Tough Mudder was the same as last—85% of the people walk <br />
the majority of the event; another 10% run between half of the obstacles. <br />
Running the whole way easily puts you in the top 5% of participants.  Aside from <br />
being well prepared physically and highly self motivated, the best way to run <br />
the whole way is to do it with a group of friends.</p>
