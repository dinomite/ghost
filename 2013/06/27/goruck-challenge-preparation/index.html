<p>I did the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/events/Challenge">GORUCK Challenge</a> last <br />
weekend.  The GORUCK Challenge is a 12 hour guided tour of a city, led by <br />
special forces guys known as the Cadre.  Every challenge, even in the same city, <br />
is a different experience, tailored by the Cadre based upon their desires, the <br />
folks on the team, and what the city has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="class662summary">Class 662 Summary</h2>

<p>A team of 34 people, each with a 45-55 pound rucksack hiked &amp; ran 20 miles <br />
around San Francisco over the course of 12 hours.  We were accompanied by two 30 <br />
pound bags of quarters, a ~100 pound log, and, for about half of the time, <br />
a ~300 pound couch adorned with a 210-230 pound person. In the last few hours, <br />
we swapped the couch for a pair of 250 pound logs.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>

<p>Overall the event was a <em>ton</em> of fun.  Having read numerous things in the weeks <br />
leading up to this, my first challenge, I had gotten a bit worried.  The number <br />
of people who listed this as the hardest thing they'd ever done and hinted <br />
at the misery they endured made it sound like a rough, "Well, I'm glad I did <br />
that. Once." sort of thing.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If <br />
you're physically capable, you'll have a good time until the end.</p>

<p>What do I mean by capable?  I don't think a single test other than the Challenge <br />
itself (or perhaps doing a Light and saying it was easy) could make it clear, <br />
but I can put it in CrossFit terms.  CrossFit + weight lifting is my main <br />
regimen, 3-4 days a week at <a href="http://www.patriotcrossfit.com/blog/">Patriot CrossFit</a> <br />
in Arlington if you want to get an idea of the programming.  I'm certainly no <br />
firebreather, but I manage to do a majority of the workouts as prescribed and <br />
in fairly good time.  If you can follow the <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/">main site</a>, <br />
doing half of the workouts as prescribed without being horribly slow, you'll be <br />
fine.  You need not be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ27XzR3HJc">Jason Kaplan</a> <br />
to be in good enough shape—my 7 minute Fran is enough to make the Challenge a <br />
non-killer event.</p>

<h1 id="notesonpreparation">Notes on Preparation</h1>

<h2 id="hydration">Hydration</h2>

<p>I say hydration here because I think something more than water is important. <br />
I used a <a href="https://www.goruck.com/Gear/Details/low-profile-hydration-bladder">low-profile SOURCE bladder</a> <br />
which fit well in the main compartment between my bricks and the main flap. <br />
I filled it with water and 6 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QW1L72/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B001QW1L72&amp;adid=16NHVNWNJT4379CHRA7K&amp;">Nuun tablets</a> <br />
initially, and tossed in a few more tablets when I refilled at around 0300.  We <br />
didn't stop for water again and I was out near the end of the challenge, along <br />
with most of the team.  If my next Challenge is anywhere warmer, I'll find a way <br />
to have a second bladder or even a couple of Nalgenes.</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>I often deride cyclists for their obsession with fast carbs, thinking that <br />
without sucking down maltodextrin every 20 minutes they might just go from being <br />
a world-class überathelete on their Yellow Polkadot Single Baller Edition <br />
Cervélo to a prole riding a Mongoose.  But it is to cyclists whom I turned when <br />
gathering supplies for this challenge.  In the end, I downed seven gels and two <br />
packs of chewie jobbies throughout the 12 hours.  Are those absolutely <br />
necessary?  Not at all, I could have gotten through without any of that and <br />
gone strict paleo with some bananas or some such.  But it would have sucked. <br />
Having good blood sugar support after glycogen stores are depleted increases <br />
your ability to perform for sure; more importantly, the carbohydrate combined <br />
with caffeine improves mood, keeping the event from being a gruelling death <br />
march.</p>

<p>So hit up your local bike shop and get some of those goofy fast acting <br />
carbohydrate sources.  I had a couple of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010TADUW/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0010TADUW&amp;adid=01XQGWDWXR3T3TSYGRMM&amp;">Honey Stingers</a> <br />
(which are mostly honey) but most of what I brought were caffeinated (35mg or
70mg depending on the flavor) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007I6NLFU/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B007I6NLFU&amp;adid=0YDREPJX49416514ZN73&amp;">Gu Roctane</a> <br />
energy gels.  I drink tea regularly, so I think the regular-strength (35mg) ones <br />
were best for me.  Next time I'll probably bring 10 gels along with a bunch of <br />
the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041HKO3G/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0041HKO3G&amp;adid=1KMX5P2VRMECJ8Q9Q0NJ&amp;">chewie versions</a>. <br />
The chewies are amazingly delightful after you've speed marched across the city. <br />
If you're the prepared sort, it'd be good to bring some extra.  Even amongst <br />
such a rarefied group there are knuckleheads who bring little to no food.  If <br />
someone's performance falls off, a caffeinated gel is a great way to bring them <br />
back.</p>

<p>I also brought a few bars (Luna or UberFood, I think) but only ate one.  It's <br />
nice to have something different during a long break (5 minutes).</p>

<h2 id="clothing">Clothing</h2>

<p>This challenge was during June in San Francisco.  For those who don't know, <br />
that's winter.  Paradoxically, it wasn't windy <em>or</em> foggy that night, but it was <br />
a bit cold.</p>

<p>I wore Under Armour leggings, some Champion workout shorts, <a href="http://www.drymaxsocks.com/running_hyper_thin.php">Drymax socks</a>, <br />
a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00275Q8ZW/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B00275Q8ZW&amp;adid=0JWP8VED4W44F2TK8VZ7&amp;">padded football shirt</a>, <br />
a long-sleeve Under Armour Cold Gear top, and a workout shirt over that.</p>

<p>Unsure of my shoe choice up until the day of The Challenge, I settled on Inov8 <br />
F-Lite 195s.  I've been wearing minimalist shoes (Merrel Trail Gloves are my <br />
favorites) exclusively for a few years now, but I was concerned that the extra <br />
weight on my back would lead to a Bad Time for my feet &amp; knees.  I had bought <br />
some F-Lite 230s which were what I had planed on until the day of, but I settled <br />
on the 195s because my feet feel better in them.  They were just fine, despite <br />
the weight and surfaces we were walking on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/surgeonknot.htm"><img src="http://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/FinishedSurgeonKnot1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>The other thing you need to do is <a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/surgeonknot.htm">tie your shoes properly</a>. <br />
If you can slip your shoes off without untying them, they aren't tied properly. <br />
We had to stop multiple times during our first time hack in which we needed to <br />
cover 3.5 miles in 35 minutes due to shoes that came untied or got flat tired. <br />
Properly tying your shoes completely prevents both of these and will keep your <br />
teammates from thinking you're incompetent from the beginning.</p>

<p>Pockets.  You want pockets.  Movements are often an hour or more, during which <br />
time you don't have opportunity to dig around your pack for the aforementioned <br />
sugary delights.  Every time you stop, ensure your pockets have a gel or two in <br />
them.  Pockets are also where you'll shove the trash after you down one of those <br />
as cadre are strict about littering, rightly so.</p>

<h2 id="yourruck">Your Ruck</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/9159389132/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5540/9159389132_4c88fea201_c.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/9159343672/"><img class=right src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/9159343672_fa6d911781.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Do something to your ruck so that you can differentiate it from everyone elses. <br />
All cadre are different, but you'll end up taking your ruck off and passing it <br />
to teammates at some point in the night, and if they all look the same, it's <br />
impossible to find your own.  I had a light-colored War Stories &amp; Free Beer <br />
patch so that I could identify my GR1 from the back; the loops of cord that I <br />
use to hold my hydration tube makes it notable from the front.</p>

<p>Having a black Omega carabiner clipped through three MOLLE sure does look cool, <br />
but it's not particularly funcitonal.  I have one on my ruck and it's nice for <br />
briefly attaching a water bottle or my bike helmet, but it's really difficult <br />
to remove for other uses.  When your ruck is jammed full of bricks, water, and <br />
yoga blocks, you can't manipulate the fabric enough to remove the 'biner <br />
easily, so save yourself the hassle and have it only clipped through two loops <br />
so that it's faster to get at.</p>

<h2 id="otherjunk">Other Junk</h2>

<p>Minimize it, but don't go crazy.  There are endless words written to the effect <br />
of "if you're not sure, don't bring it".  I largely subscribe to this mentality, <br />
as you most likely aren't going to need things, but there's a dose of realism <br />
that is needed here.  Between the 30 pounds of bricks and the 10 pounds of <br />
water and misc that are the minimum weight, you aren't going to notice a few <br />
extra food bars, gels, or a windbreaker, so don't sweat it.  If the weather is <br />
on the edge of being cold, bring the windbreaker.  I always carry a Sharpie &amp; <br />
a pen in my ruck day to day and was sad that I didn't have them when we needed <br />
to write things down.</p>

<p>Things to certainly not bring are those that will absorb water.  Carrying around <br />
a small portion of your local body of water is a bad time.</p>
